Welcome to my version of the GA TicTacToe project. You can find the working link to what I have so far above.

### Technologies Used: 
* JavaScript

Here is a link to my initial project outline: 
![Scopy study project](https://git.generalassemb.ly/cymbiotica/game-project-scope-study/blob/response/study.md)

### Planning
I used the above linked scope study information to create this app. I started witha wireframe, that I have since changed the layout but it was a base. I made a decision to try to use the templating engine called Handlebars to try to do some dynamic loading of HTML to keep with the SPA requirement. I found that I was unable to use it the way I wished and have added it to the list of TODO items.
As for problem solving, I did do a lot of looking at code that exists out there to get a base to build up from. During the actual coding I tended to rely on a lot of console.log and debugger statements. 
There is a circular dependacy in my code, hopefully I can find it during my future passes through and during updates. For now I used a slight hack to get around it. I essentially I split the file into two and used only the pieces I needed where I needed. 

### Unresolved issues and features
As of this writing, the night before presentation, I am unable to update the game on the server in order to persist (through disconnects, etc). I have not even thought about how to cover multiplayer either. My styling is also very basic at this time. The score is not updating either.
